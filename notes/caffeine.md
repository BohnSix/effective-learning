### What Is Caffeine Addiction?
```
Caffeine is a central nervous system stimulant that has the ability to enhance concentration, increase metabolism, and boost mood. Whether it comes from coffee, tea, energy drinks, or soda, many people feel like they “need” caffeine in the morning to increase alertness and the motivation to work. More than 90% of adults regularly drink caffeine in the United States, consuming an average of 200 mg of caffeine per day – the equivalent of two 6-ounce coffees or five 12-ounce cans of soft drinks. In most cases, drinking caffeinated beverages is a relatively safe, non-harmful habit; however, when the need for caffeine crosses the line from a pleasant pick-me-up to a daily necessity, it can be indicative of an addiction.

### Signs of a Caffeine Addiction
```
Rather than the actual amount of caffeine consumed per day, caffeine addiction is characterized by the way that the substance affects an individual’s day-to-day functioning. The severity of the addiction is calculated based on how distressed someone feels when they want caffeine and can’t get it, and how much of a disruption this causes in their daily life.

The 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders does not recognize caffeine addiction as a substance abuse disorder, but it does recognize it as a condition for future study. According to the DSM-V, problematic caffeine consumption is characterized by at least three of the following criteria:

A persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control caffeine use
Continued caffeine use despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or exacerbated by caffeine
Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following:
The characteristic withdrawal syndrome for caffeine
Caffeine (or a closely related substance) is taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms
Caffeine is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was intended
Recurrent caffeine use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at work, school, or home
Continued caffeine use despite having persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of caffeine
Tolerance, as defined by either of the following:
A need for markedly increased amounts of caffeine to achieve desired effect
Markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of caffeine
A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain caffeine, use caffeine, or recover from its effects
Craving or a strong desire or urge to use caffeine
```
### Caffeine Withdrawal
```
Caffeine withdrawal is a medically-recognized condition that occurs when people experience significant symptoms after abruptly quitting caffeine consumption. These symptoms typically appear within a day of quitting and can last a week or more.

Symptoms of caffeine withdrawal include:

Headache
Irritability
Fatigue
Anxiety
Difficulty concentrating
Depressed mood
Tremors
Low energy

Gradually reducing caffeine intake over several weeks instead of quitting “cold turkey” can help reduce the severity of withdrawal symptoms. Compared to other addictions, the withdrawal and recovery period from caffeine is relatively short. Most caffeine addiction symptoms can be resolved in 7-12 days of consumption reduction. During that period, the brain will naturally decrease the number of adenosine receptors on each cell, responding to the sudden lack of caffeine. If an individual can decrease intake until it becomes nothing within a few weeks, the levels of adenosine receptors in the brain will reset to their baseline levels, and the addiction will be broken.
