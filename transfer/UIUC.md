- uiuc文理学院的cs都是cs+x，传统的有数学统计等等，还有很多新的项目.以前稍微了解过Math cs这个项目，感觉cs课程选择上有所限制，对Math要求也高，总得来说感觉选课没那么灵活，因为要结合两个专业。当然难度也没有非常大，工作量肯定小于两个专业都修.然后就是一些工院的福利可能享受不到，比如本硕五年连读只有工院cs才可以申请。曾经还有免费打印但现在没了。选课优先级好像是一样的。至于科研我觉得影响不大
- 区别真的不大，但转学录取难度差太多了。对以后科研什么的也几乎没什么影响，所以建议楼主不要头铁申工院了。
- 工院和文理的难度差蛮多，身边本来能录UMich文理的背景跑去申了工院，结果gg

- Essay
    - In 300 words or less, describe how your academic interest and/or professional goals will be fulfilled in your intended program of study at Illinois.If you’re applying to the Division of General Studies, explain your academic interests and strengths or your future career goals. You may include any majors or areas of study you are currently considering.
    
    - Tips for Writing Your Essay
        - Be memorable.
            - The essay portion of the application is important because it gives us further insight into who you are and who you want to be. Make us remember you!
        - Be prepared.
           - Take time to think about and brainstorm your message. Create an outline, write a good first draft, and edit multiple times.
        - Be yourself.
           - We want to know more about you, so be honest and let us into your world. Instead of making broad statements about what you want to do, provide specific examples from high school or extracurricular activities. And don’t be afraid to add your personal style and voice to your writing!
        - Be direct.
            - You only have a couple of paragraphs to tell us that you’re not only qualified to attend Illinois, but you're also ready for the challenge and will make the most of your experience. Choose your words wisely.
        - Be focused.
            - It's not necessary for you to repeat information that’s already elsewhere in your application. Stay focused on explaining how those credentials and qualifications will lead to a successful future here.
        - Be professional.
            - Submitting a sloppy-looking essay with spelling errors and glaring mistakes sends us the message that you’re not serious about Illinois. Proofread your essays and ask your counselor, a friend, or a parent to take a second look.
            
- International Applicants：https://admissions.illinois.edu/Apply/international
    - Academic Credentials
        - To be considered for admission, you must complete a program of study that qualifies you for admission to selective universities in your own country.
    - Required Military Service
        - If you’re from a country that requires military service upon completion of secondary education, you shouldn't apply until this obligation has been met. We won't delay admission in this case.
    - Required Documents by Country
        - We require certain documents depending on where you're from. Transfer applicants need to send these to us when they apply. Freshmen should wait until after they're admitted.
    - If You're Admitted
        - As an admitted international student, you'll also have to take additional steps in order to enroll. While you don't need to do any of these things right now, we thought you might want to take note!
